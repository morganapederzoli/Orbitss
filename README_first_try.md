# Orbitss
trying to find if some orbits are regular or chaotic using correlation integral

this is the first version of the program, it works so i kept it there to prevent future catastrophes

notes:

it was meant for python2

it's VERY slow

the distance in the whole phase space is not cenceptually correct
